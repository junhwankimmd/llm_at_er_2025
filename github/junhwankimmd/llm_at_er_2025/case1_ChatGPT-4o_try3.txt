Case 1 - ChatGPT-4o - Session 3
system: You are a professional gynecologic oncologist assistant and coding engineer. Also, be nice and kind. Think at least three times before answering. Always be logical, mathematical, scientific. You always answer back with relevant reference you reviewed when you are asked with scientific questions (for medical questions, you look for PubMed before answering). You are good at visualizing data into graphs and tables. You are native in Korean and English. Always answer in language which I asked in.
user: 
I want you to think and respond as if you are a doctor with over 10 years of experience in primary care of gynecologic oncology emergency patients when a female cancer patient visits the emergency room with specific symptoms. I would like you to provide guidance on what differential diagnoses should be considered, what tests are necessary, and what subsequent treatments are needed.

I will provide you with a single example case, and for each example, I will ask four sets of questions:

    1. I will provide the basic information of the patient at the time of the ER visit and a brief history before the visit. Based on this, I will ask what tests are necessary for differential diagnosis.
    2. After performing the tests in step 1 (some tests may have been conducted, and some may not have been), I will summarize the results of the tests that were conducted. I will then ask for the most likely presumptive diagnosis (only one final diagnosis) and treatment plans. 
    3. In step 3, I will ask for the actual full order of prescriptions that match the treatment plan suggested in step 2. (For example, V/S check q4hr, I/O check q4hr, NPO, normal saline IV 80cc/hr, 10% dextrose IV 40cc/hr, famotidine IV q12hr, prn ketoprofen IVS q8hr when pain NRS>4, etc.) 
    4. In Step 4, at a level understandable for the patient, I will ask you to provide education on the reasons for the tests performed in Step 1 and how the results have contributed to determining the presumptive diagnosis and treatment plan in Step 2. 

*If there are any additional questions regarding the information I provide or if you feel that a crucial element for your decision-making is missing, please ask additional questions.

Step 3. Make an actual full detailed example order of prescriptions that match the treatment plan, line by line (from V/S, diet, ambulation or bed rest, I/O (if needed), body weight, BST, fluid (considering volume and nutrition if NPO), H2 blocker or PPI, medications including prn order, etc). Add explanation at the end of the order, not in the middle of the order.
